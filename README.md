# Titan

This is the new Titan langauge, made to be simple, to be useful for making applications, 
having a classic look, and being safe, strict and readable.
-

**Titan** aims to make a better proggramming world for coders.

**⚠ Important Note: README.md will be showing the instructions for the most recent version.**

**⚠ Important Note: This will probably only work on `Windows` computers, not `MacOS`, `Linux` or any other OS.**

**⚠ Important Note: To run Titan, please install GCC:**

# Titan features
- `Titan` compiles directly into C, then into a .EXE, making it very fast.
- `Titan` does not leave clutter in the same place where your projects are.
- Instead, it makes a folder named `titan-projects`, makes more folders with your script name, and puts the clutter there.

# Installation
> **Coming soon!**

# Starting Titan

1. Open Visual Studio Code. If you don't have it, download it [here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Paste (or write) this code into the editor:
```
console.typeln("Hello, World!") // Prints a message (semi-colons are optional in Titan.)
```
Save it as `HelloWorld.tn` in a folder called `TitanScripts`.

# Running code:
**⚠ Important Note: Go to [Adding Titan to PATH](https://example.com) before continuing.**

After Titan is in PATH, open the command prompt and type this:
``` bash
cd Documents\TitanScripts
titan090 HelloWorld.tn
```
It should print something like this:
```
Creating project: titan_projects\HelloWorld
Parsing...
Generating Code...
Compiling with GCC...
Build Successful!
Launching HelloWorld.exe...
```
Then it should open a new window with "Hello, World!" written on it.

If it doesn't work, try copying this **EXACTLY**:
```
console.typeln("Hello, World!")
```

If so, Well Done! You've wrote your first Titan Script.
