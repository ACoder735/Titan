# Titan

**This is the new Titan langauge, made to be:**
- 🎯 Simple 
- 📖 Readable
- 🔥 Fast
- 🎛 Controllable

**Titan** aims to make a better proggramming world for coders.

**⚠ Important Note: README.md will be showing the instructions for the most recent version.**

**⚠ Important Note: This will probably only work on `Windows` computers, not `MacOS`, `Linux` or any other OS.**

**⚠ Important Note: To run Titan, please install GCC:**
> To compile and run Titan code, you need GCC installed via MSYS2.
> ## Step 1: Install MSYS2
> 
> Go to https://www.msys2.org/.
> 
> Download the installer. `msys2-x86_64-20251213.exe` or `msys2-arm64-20251213.exe` (ARM64)
> 
> Run the installer. Keep the default installation path (C:\msys64).
> 
> Step 2: Install GCC (MinGW-w64)
> 
> Open the "MSYS2 UCRT64" terminal from your Start Menu.
> 
> Run the following command to update the package database:
> ```
> pacman -Syu
> ```
> If the terminal closes, reopen it and run this command to install the GCC compiler toolchain:
> ```
> pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
> ```
> (Press Y to confirm installation).

# Titan features
- `Titan` compiles directly into C, then into a .EXE, making it very fast.
- `Titan` does not leave clutter in the same place where your projects are.
- Instead, it makes a folder named `titan-projects`, makes more folders with your script name, and puts the clutter there.

# Installation

# Running:
