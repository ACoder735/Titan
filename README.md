# Titan

This is the new Titan langauge, made to be simple, to be useful for making applications, 
having a classic look, and being safe, strict and readable.

**Titan** aims to make a better proggramming world for coders.

**⚠ Important Note: This will probably only work on `Windows` computers, not `Mac`, `Lunix` or any other OS.**

# Installation
> **Coming soon!**

# Starting Titan

1. Open Visual Studio Code. (If you don't have it, download it here: [https://code.visualstudio.com/])

2. Paste (or write) this code into the editor:
```
import "std"* # Imports the standard library

func main(){ # Runs every time the code starts
  console.typeln("Hello, World!") # Prints a message (semi-colons are optional in Titan.)
}
```
